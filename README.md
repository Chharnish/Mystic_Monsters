# Mystic_Monsters
Final exam code for CS120
This code is still in a work in progress stage.

I plan to finish the entire code as this project has really got my gears turning on what I can do in a python text environment.

How to play:

Menus will be shown in the window.

type in the number and only the number that corresponds to the option you want to select and press <ENTER>

if no quit button is available, press <ENTER> to return back to the previous menu (Usually in battle menus and in inventory menus.

Your objective is to venture out and defeat any monsters you may encounter.

Use the town's shop and inn to your advantage if you have the gold for it of course.

There are final bosses in the game but only one has been included.



There is a debug menu included in the code to be able to test out certain functions of the program.

if you wish to access this menu, type in 63 and press <ENTER> 

(NOTE) The debug menu is not meant for normal operation of the code therefore the debug menu code has not been refined or "idiot proofed" in any way due to the interest of time.

You may experience crashes if you use this menu. You have been warned..
